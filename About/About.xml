  This is a BETA featuring the Corruption biome.
  
How it works:
  1. Settle anywhere, or add to an existing game
  2. Corruption will spread through your world
  3. After your map is corrupted, encounter creatures with too many eyes
  
Corruption will differ based on where you are on the world map.
  
FAQ:
  How fast does Corruption spread?
	It's sped up for the beta, and takes 1-2 weeks to cover a default world.
  Boss fights?
	No.
